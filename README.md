# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this project is to perform the employee database analysis using different csv datasets tables over 20,000 employees. The company is reviewing staffing metrics, who is eligible for retirement titles.
Our retiring employees data shows the titles of all employees born between Jan 01,1955 to Dec 01, 1955. The table we created included emp_no, first_name and last_name columns from employees table and retrieved thee titles from_date and to_date columns of the titles table in our employee database challenge. We joined the tables using primary and foreign key  and created unique_titles csv  using distinct on and order by count query. 
The second deliverable we wrote a query that retrieved columns from our employees and dept_emp table, filtered data on current employees born in 1965 then ordered the table by emp_no.
